Welcome to my personal website repository! This is straighforwad Vue.js frontend application, with the
objective of serving as a frontend boilerplate for my personal projects.

The production website can be viewed at https://www.billygrossman.com.

## Component Library & CSS Helpers

I chose not to use an existing UI framework for the sake of simplicity. The idea is to have only what is required on hand, with new components and UI treatments being added as needed.

The component library can be viewed here https://www.billygrossman.com/components.
