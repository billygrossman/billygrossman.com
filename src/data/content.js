              I'm Billy, and I'm a problem solver, a team player, and a communicator. I’m
              excited about all things related to web, engineering, and application
              development. I've designed online solutions and architected projects of
              various shapes and sizes while working with different types of businesses.
              No two projects are the same, therefore I'm constantly improving my
              abilities, adding new tools to my toolkit, and staying up to date on the
              latest technologies and best practices.
